Not only boring words and questions, also have some interesting challenges for you, enjoy it. your first level, pass the maze system, the police dog, remember it's not like the dog you saw in tuanthanh's challenge, it's quiet and quick, and will suddenly bite you, be careful, the camera and all the sistem can help you look have been neutralized, play well, hahahahahahahahahahahahaahaah!:sign.ogg

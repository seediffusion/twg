Upon pressing enter on UW.exe you will hear some music. You've successfully logged into the client. There is an option to create a new account and also, one for account storage where up to two of your characters along with the passwords will be stored. so that, you can easily switch between them. Note! that you may have the same password for both your characters.

Once you have created your character, you may log in whereby you (your character) will be in a small map called the main house. Feel free to explore the house by using your arrow keys to walk around, left, right, up to go forwards, and down to walk backwards. Press Alt R to sit and stand. press page up and page down to climb up and down respectively.

Press shift space to jump, with the arrow keys to jump in that direction. F to check the direction your are facing, Q and E to turn 90 degrees respectfully.

Each character has a bag or an inventory. Press I to open it and escape to close it. You might want to open it now to receive a starter pack. To do this, open  your inventory and you will find the starter pack. To open it, like you would anything else in the game, press either your left or your right arrow key to put it in your left or right hand respectfully, escape out and press T to open it.

Inventory commands are as follows, left arrow, put an item in your left hand; Right arrow to your right hand; tab to move through the inventory by category, up and down arrows to move through the main category or any of the sub categories. escape, as I said to exit. The number 1 key is your left hand, and number 2 is your right hand.

Use the arrow keys and home / end keys while holding down `Alt` will move the selected item to above or below, and top or bottom, respectively.

At the time of writing this inventory, you get some cooked fish in your starter pack. Go ahead and eat some fish using the key strokes above. When you have the cooked fish in one hand, press space to eat it. Space will action anything in the focussed hand. Alt space will do an alternate action.

You will also receive five staff gifts in your starter pack. Open them as described above with the starter pack.

There is some instructions in the house. Why don't you try and find them and read more about the game. There's plenty of people to ask too. However, here is a little more information if you would prefer to read in this format.

when you get familiar with how a few basic things work, you might want to turn off your newbie flag by typing the equals sign and typing "newbie!.

You will be able to purchase (with UW coins) so many things; food, drinks, weapons, ammo, houses and much much more.

Have fun looking in the mall and, stores within the mall.

You can creat teams or simply join a team and compete with other teams for points, just for a bit of friend rivalry.

We welcome you to explore for yourself what the other keystrokes do as there is a multitude of them, and it's half the fun working it all out.

## Map Building
Finally, would you like to build a map? Let's get you started.

First of all, you need to know how coordinates work; One coordinate makes up one tile. In all maps, The X -coordinate goes from left to right, Y goes forward and back, Z is up and down (or high to low).

Go to the Ultra world's menu found in the main map, coordinates 5 1 0. Enter on that and cursor down to "create new map. You will be asked if it's a 2D or 3D map. Note, 2D only has the X and Y coordinates and 3D has the Z as well

You'll be asked to set the min X, Max X, Min Y, Max Y, Min Z, max Z, in other words, this will determine the size of your map, though you can change it later. Once you have set all of them by following the promts and pressing enter, you will be asked to select a surface for your map. There are literally hundreds to choose from. Select one, press enter. Congratulations you have started your map successfully.

If you want to make walls and platforms you use the tile option within the builder menu which you get to by pressing B. Here is a quick rundown on each of the menus in the builder menu: Since we are updating to NVGT and hence extra options, I won't go into too much detail now.

The following is a list of available options:
- Tile: As stated above, any surface that you walk on. You also make walls with this option.
- Zone: Where you can describe the location, such as a chair, or the bedroom. Supports map variables.
- Death Message: The message to use when someone dyes. This can be repeated to make the randomized message. Supports DMG map variables.
- Sound source: Where you can add a sound to all or part of your map. Just simply follow the prompts to fill in the coordinates where you want your sound to be, then select from a huge list of sounds, press enter and follow the prompts again to adjust the volume and pitch of the sound and press enter.
- Reverb: Add reverb to your map. The ID is necesarily required and must not be duplicated. ID is internally used to determine on which reverb effect is the player standing on, especially maps with 2 or more reverbs.
- Music is very similar but there are more music tracks in the menu. You can also choose to have the music play as an ambience or not.
- Time Sound: You can have a sound play at a certain time frequency.
- Time music: similar to above.
- Auto mover: Moves the player from a certain place, to a certain place in your map.
- Door: you can create a door in your map, also a password protected door and an item taker door, meaning a player can give an item to it when enter is pressed, example, you can make these at restaurants when you want the player to pay money to enter.
- Safe zone: Where a player is safe from dying or losing safe cards.
- Starting point: You set this in the coordinates that you want the player to enter into the map.
- Death Point: where the player spawns when he dies.
- Sign: Self explanatory really. Use this to play a sign for players of your map to read. Supports map variables.
- Txt: Similar to sign, here you can write some text for the player to read but without any sound associated with it. Supports map variables.
- Timed Text: Similar to timed sound and music, you can have some text show at a certain time frequency.
- Dialog: More than one line of text which you separate by pressing equals.
- Automatic Dialog: Like a dialog, but if the player steps on the tile/s, it will display.
- Checkpoint: It saves a players progress, for example, on task map so if a player dies, they won't go back to the start of the map but to where the last checkpoint has been placed.
- Forcefield: similar to a hazzard in that if a player steps on it, they will get an electric shock and lose health.
- Hazzard: You will immediately die if you step or jump on these tiles.
- Specified Air Temperature: You can specify the air temperature of the zone you set, or entire map however this doesn't work because there are no weather features currently in this game.
- Teleporter: Takes the character back to a certain point in the map.
- Vanishing Platform, a platform that vanishes at a certain time frequency and then comes back.
- Item usage restriction: A list of items can be omitted on your map or a certain zone on your map.
- Fire: You can create a fire in a certain zone or in all of your map.
- Level: you can only be at a minimum level before a player can come to your map.
- Opening hours: You can specify what time your map opens.
- PVP: You can set this as your entire map or certain parts of the map where the player has to be pvp before entering.
- Reinforcement: Like the level, you can set what reinforcement the player can be before entering the map or a certain part of the map.
- The next eight items (toilet, wash basin, shower, trash Can, bed, clock, calendar and oven) are self explanatory. You can add these to your map. It's best however to add a tile and a zone to them as well so players will know they are there, otherwise the rest of us won't know where they are located even though they work.
- URL: you can paste one into this box and it will stream the sound sorce, like a radio station (note you need to find the direct url, not simply a link to the station), or even music that you might have in dropbox. No youtube doesn't work.
- togglable features: You can toggle on and off things like night sounds, wind and other things.
- Toggle losing items after death: If the player does not have safe cards, will he lose his items if he dies or not.
- Description: Describe the map.
- Add owner: You can add an owner.
- Remove an owner: removes owner
- Add line: will add a line to the raw data.
- Edit line: Will edit a line.
- Remove a line: will remove a line.
- Make map private: If it's publicc, will take it out of the public list. Note this current update will mean you will have to ask a staff member to put it back in public should you want.
- Back up this map: Press enter on this and it will be placed in your maps directory.
- Restore backup: You can restore you map if it's been deleted and you want it back. and have it in your maps directory.
- View map stats: Will let you know the stats of your map, example, fourteen lines and other information about the map.
- Get map data: will get the data of the map.
- Put map data: Would put the data back into a map, (please read the readme regarding adding maps from other games).
- Delete This Map: deletes the map. You will spawn back into the ultra worlds menu in the main_map.

## Dynamic Variable System (DVS)
UW supports variables that can be replaced dynamically with something else. Every variable is enclosed by 2 percent signs, i.e. `%variable_name%`.

### Gender variables
These variables start with `g_` (g underline) unless otherwise noted. For example, `%g_s%`, `%g_o%`.
- `s`: Subject (he/she/they).
- `o`: Object (him/her/them)
- `pd`: Possessive determiner (his/her/their).
- `pp`: Possessive pronoun (his/hers/theirs).
- `r`: Reflexive pronoun (himself/herself/themselves).
- `n`: Noun (boy/girl/non binary).

Any such variables can append the `u_` (u underline) after the `g_` (g underline) to make the first character of the returned gender capitalized.

Examples:
- `%g_s%`: she.
- `%g_u_s%`: She.

### Map Variables
These are a list of variables that can be used in map building options such as zone, sign, and text square.

#### General
These variables are available in all instances listed above or if they are deemed map variables supported.
- All gender variables are supported with the `g_` (g underline) prepended.
- `name`: The user's name.
- `map`: The map name.

#### DMG Map Variables
The following is a list of supported variables in death message building, in addition to general variables above:
- `by`: The object of the person who is the actor of the kill, meaning the object or person who is the killer.
- `nickname`: The display name of the person or the object whom was killed.
- `zone`: The zone name relative to the coordinates of the object / person's dying.


### Message Variables
These variables are to be used with some messages and commands. The following areas are supported:
- Online and offline messages.
- The `/me` command.

### General Variables
The following variables are supported in all instances listed above:
- All gender variables are supported with the `g_` (g underline) prepended, and the determined gender is retrieved from the user who performs the action.
- `myname`: The user's name.
- `mynick`: The user's nickname.
- `name`: The name of the user who receives the message.
- `nickname`: The nickname of the user who receives the message.

Note: When setting the message, either the `myname` or the `mynick` variable must be included.

Examples:
- `%mynick% comes online, and %g_s% is now ready to play. %g_u_s% says, hello %nickname%!`
- `/me %g_u_pd% smile lights up the hole world, %g_s% is %mynick%!`

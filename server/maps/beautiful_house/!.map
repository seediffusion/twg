sign:120:140:40:60:0:0:A symbol of two souls who found peace in each other. Beneath the quiet sky, this pond rests — calm and pure, just like the love shared between two hearts across distance and time. The ripples tell a story of devotion, of love that doesn’t need loud words to be felt. Every reflection on the water carries a memory — of laughter, of waiting, of gentle faith that love will always find its way home. This is where love breathes in peace, where Fifi and Rishi’s hearts meet — not in noise, but in the quiet beauty of understanding.:silence.ogg

sign:110:119:40:60:0:0:A gentle trail that leads to the Serenity of Love Pond, where every step carries a silent vow between two hearts.

It is where Fifi and Rishi’s love walked through distance and time, finding its way to peace, to home, and to each other.:silence.ogg
